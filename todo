-----------------------------------------------Some mrtg and other database features for Megacom:
0. Voting for Megacom
1. Detach handler mode and test it on mrtg:
    + set snmp indexes and groups for all mrtg hosts in mrtg.php
    + Set new handler for scheduler: isset(odid/oid/102/mrtg.cfg) ? /usr/bin/mrtg odid/oid/102/mrtg.cfg : cfgmaker odid/oid/102/mrtg.cfg
    - F7 handler - cmd NEWPAGE tabels.app/mrtg/odid/oid/102/ip_<index>.html  Shift F7 handler - cmd NEWPAGE tabels.app/mrtg/odid/oid/102/ip_<index>_all.html
    - Get snmp of only no-down hosts??? It conflicts with one big mrtg.cfg for all hosts
2. Megacom implementation:
    - Поиск не только по ip, но и по location and hostname, поиск по клиентам
	как будут правица узлы L1 (редактировать только через карточку)?
	Славины свитчи внести 172.16..
	левый берег правый - вкладки как в мртг
	какие группы пользователей и какие им доступы
	какие сделать названия линков для дерева для мплс даунлинк аплинк2-3..
	чаты: курилка для всех, Л1-Л2, междусобойчик
    - point to point tree, and add second query in object selection to the help/doc
    - How could object selection calc objects with only one free port? Or expired orders/requests like in Helpdesk (versions date difference is more than three days?)
    - correct all mrtg host files to make correct megacom tree via links in mrtg.php (mpls links and uplink2 links are apparent)
    - add switch mac and node number for tech uchet, and soa check:
	Elements
	    1-100 ports
	    101 hostname
	    102 hardware
	    103 location
	    104 ip
	    105 mac
	    106 Model name
	    107 Up/down (alive statistic)
	    108 User to check the object
	On every element
	    History - Alt+F12
	    Tree up - Shift+F12
	    Tree down - Ctrl+F12
	    Alt+Shift+F12 - Map tree up from current object
	    Alt+Ctrl+F12 - Map tree down from current object
	    F12 port diagnostic (client) - grafic in realtime, and grafics and F12 non port diagnosti (switch with port list with their links)
	    INS - for ports (general: hint, snmpindex, link, style; description: type [free, client, service, link], zayavka-ip-speed-licevoi-name-address),
	    for hardware (hint, style, type, subtype),
	    location (tehuchet info contacts, names, loaction..)
	DBLCLICK with ctrl alt del (upload, download, unload) only for location with ctrl+alt+dblclick for GALLERY
	DBLCLICK, F2, KEYPRESS - edit for L2 only
	DEL - delete content via confirmation

-----------------------------------------------New app features for Megacom:
1. Automatic change view notification (analyze new object version match for every view of database and view element match element changed)
2. Any single line stores in OD without changes, any single line with Enter and then Backspace should be stored the way it is in the 1st case - but it is stored 1st case + '\n'
3. To allow html table in cells add tr, td, tbody and table tags to allowed tags?
4. Links instead of real jpegs
5. Slava develop: MAP, telnet, snmp platform
6. TREE:
    Tree element layout: style (for example to see what nodes are down by seeing them via red background)
    Tree wire name (arrow name) to mark fiber cooper radio..
    element link hint (per element text line) to show full element value
    regexp search
    context menu expand/hide uplink and downlink subtree
    loop element - show real looped object instead of read message
    hint for link name
    context menu description for tree view (object number, object selection parameteres..)
    point to point scheme must be one way, why its not?
7. Handler cmd line replacements - <oid> (plus point that oid can be retreived also <{"element":"id"}>) <date> <OD>, <OV>, <ODid>, <OVid> <attahced files path> parse in a handler command line
8. Change favicon -> tabels
9. Table build and <tr> adding via timeout, so any quick view refresh sholdn't reload (shtoby stranica ne morgala) the page
    Do not display reload message in the main view if OV starts refreshing less than one second (or half a second) for a example
    Anyway - make OV starting refresh main view just right after table width calculation than add <tr> (or <tr> portion) one by one to not lock the browser
    This allowes to not only avoid page freeze, but any incoming CALL/TABLE/TREE message will be handled immediately with a new data and droping previous CALL message data from controller - 
    this method allowes to avoid browser insufficient memory error while big amount of OV data comes quickly for client browser not having time to handle that OV big growing data.
    Calling all hosts, then calling 'random 2 hosts' - 'random 2 host' is opened then all hosts is opened instead
    Move log to task log manager
    Optimize x,y expressions: if x=n+1, then don't call eval, but plus 1 to n (in case of one of default layout, which x,y expressions are known)
10. nohup server and scheduler start, or may be container
11. Keep parameters in view history navigating, to open last viewed OV with input parameters used before.
12. multi cell selecting - copy (excel table), delete (removes all selected objects) with new user event 'DELETE' for every removing object
13. Multipile select for _.php
14. warning as a start event 
15. Negative queue value (the scheduler sleep for) in msec on crontab line
16. In context menu description display Od and OV description from OV structure

-----------------------------------------------Some systems emulation for Megacom:
1. Corp chat
2. Corp adrbook
3. Any request app (Helpdesk, Jira)
4. MRTG
5. Zabbix (See how zabbix is install to have point of view of that kind of applications)
6. CRM
7. ACS
8. Any accounting system (may be billing)
9. Some excel functions
10. Voting
11. Any statistic/analitycs
12. Setki.xls
13. Tech uchet
14. Wiki
15. Operation Journal:
    Switch ip, switch description, switch location,
    60 ports (description), for every port: type (uplink,downlink,free,service,client),
    diagnostic (pings, grafiki, port config, port errors, asr speed, mac, mac-vendor, checkhost, name from billing) and convert all this info to pdf in a new tab, if port type is 'client', then display client name from billing
    In INFO scheme find mac on every switch in OV
    In setki - ip, name from TABELS, name from BILLING, mac (for buhgalters and FSB)
    Button to destruct client conf,int et 1/0/2,shut, no fl c, no band c,  sw mode acc,  sw acc vl 666,  speed aut, end,wr
    see client mac, cable length, errors and all other data the switch allows to monitor
    ping <switch ip>, on port ping <client ip>
16. Paraga mail functional
17. Ask Hramcova analitiku po helpdesku
18. See functions on Slava's management system

-----------------------------------------------Implementation stages for Megacom:
1. First stage: oper+slavina, setki, tech uchet, HD, adrbook
2. Second stage: zabbix, CRM, corp chat, wiki

-----------------------------------------------Application:
  regexp search as start event emulates ctrl+shift+f at OV open
  hiderow/hidecolumn - regexp feature with flag i for all cells in rows/columns match successful case
  add rule action 'do nothing' (for log only goal and some db sql actions)
  Second and all next queries for non Tree view types are queries in previous query tables
  regexp search - range js instead of span highlighting
  Paste file or image to object element (or drag and drop to the corresponded cell)
  Release 'view in a new tab' via call cmd, for example to show user object versions apparently main view in a new tab      https://question-it.com/questions/1384714/otkryt-novuju-vkladku-okno-i-napisat-v-nee-chto-nibud
  Downloading big files don't show progress bar downloading process, so how to show it?
  Fetch progress for uploading files https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/upload
  Application version in System description, tel number for additional help tab 'Contacts' and mail functional - please contact us support@tabels.app
  Export OV data to xls/txt file
  autocomplete feature after handler edit command. Autocomplete data may be retrieved from other OD, for example, client list or street list.
  what about edit after edit command, for a example wrong text to confirm and edit command called once again?
  GALLERY shows all foto for default, otherwise - specified foto
    Show image properties (like resolution) in GALLERY mode
  not only regexp search but search on mask with only one asterisk as a special char
  macroses like in joe
  virt cell depends on oid,eid
  Context menu Graph
  Task manager: restrict call (and call with no task delete option) of task manager for some users in user props, and use ps ax with client side handling instead of dialog generation by taskmanager.php for more quicker processing!
  At the end of app stable version make new customization
  Any cell has attached files. Cell text is displayed for default, but if image prop is set - display image, if audio prop is set display player like in whatsup, if stream prop is set - display stream fro camera (like forpost)
    in cell: text, image (in case of 'image' prop set - image is displayed on the table insted of text value prop;), stream, table?

-----------------------------------------------JS, PHP, SQL, Highload:
  Optimize mysql to highload app:
    use one function to operate sql commands in order to migrate to another database type - not related, for a example, or mysql instead of maria db
    index columns: alter table data_1 add index (`lastversion`);
    unbuffered queries and partial OV output mysql_unbuffered_query()
    https://www.sqlstyle.guide/ru/
  Problems of deploying - can i use maria db on commerisal base? 
  Use another user (instead of root) with priv granted to 'OEDB' database only and Unicode for MySQL https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4 http://phpfaq.ru/mysql/charset
  secure php.ini and can socket number be more than 1024?
  What time and bytes limit should be set to php script execution
  Secure database and sources to avoid assignment of my intellectual property. Incuded php files should be on unaccessable for user and not application dir. Restrict function dir from observing at the browser.
  socket rate limit https://javascript.info/websocket#rate-limiting
  To prevent user DDOS by user pressing F2 (for a example) user handler should be executed as a apparent apps and only once by one user?
  Secure: check origin header to be http or https to 192.168.9.39, The point here is, you have to check your websocket activity and determine rate limit: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-secure-your-websocket-connections-d0be0996c556/
  divide core.php to make separate php file to be included in wrapper.php to make wrapper execution more faster
  See how zabbix is installed to have a point of view of serious application
  Big amount of users generates apparent DB records in queueviewcall function while user INIT or DELETE,
    so add/delete objects in a view with 10000 users attached will generate 10000 records (record pre user) to call the view to be refreshed, its too slowly
  All db operations (except handlers in wrapper.php, db config) should use the connection via user with read-only permissions to OE9. Or use rollBack at the end of read-only operation?
  Use pcntl_fork in schedulerwrapper.php in order to share var scope end exlude per handler db connection in wrapper.php
  All internal database structure should be stored in RAM SQL tuning

-----------------------------------------------Sidebar and main view front-end:
  exlude blinking while refreshing sidebar (dont refresh in case of no changes) and smooth OD expanded to the view list
  non table area selecting - compare event mouse coordinate from drag x1,y1 and increase/decrease drag x2,y2 coordinate so
  smooth scrolling for rows more than 500 - event preventdefault on scroll event plus settimeout (dispatch scrolling event, 100);
  effects at navigating images in GALLERY just like in drive.ru
  Sort by header click for look like default element layout when header line at the top, bottom, left, right
  One or multiple cell selecting - buffer copy as text or/and as image (like excelc cells are copied into whatsup)

-----------------------------------------------Dialog boxes front-end:
    Expanded list in OD edit structure is binded to lower textarea
    Footer key works in case of dragging textarea and then left button release on that footer key OK/cancel. That's wrong!
    dialog boxes on low resolution, exclude dialog to be out of the screen and adjust box size to fit the page,   Adaptivka after browser window size has changed dialog box has gone away
    when pushed button is pushed and mouse cursor is out of button - make button released
    show timer in dialog button text. Fix not only scrollLeft/Top, but current pad/profile
    Features: arrow icon for select, expanded list sort on alphabet/appearance (increasing, decreasing) via arrows on right side
	      from the select div,
	      highlite 'New rule|view|element' in the expanded div,
	      radio tag (and may be not only this tag) loses its positin after textarea tag in case of no 'line': '',
	      input text tag whole parent div width
	      content scrolling with pads stay on the top (now pad area is scrolled with the content)
	      pad.profile.element style prop - not only for header and for interface element of itself!
	      OD Dialog Box - OD icon, OV icon (or ov type  icons for table, tree and so on), OV shortcut key

-----------------------------------------------Controller:
  prevent multiple call controller on one element from one user, example: multiple key press while server didn't respond the previous event
  If last log message equals previous - don't log it, just increment previous log message counter

-----------------------------------------------Handlers:
  UPDATE handler command (in a addition to SET/RESET) that creates object version only in case of at least one user-defined element change
  EDIT controller cmd limits text lines number to edit https://toster.ru/q/355711     https://toster.ru/q/518758   http://qaru.site/questions/190792/limiting-number-of-characters-in-a-contenteditable-div
  Non local server (cloud) implemented handlers
  handler command to copy data to the buffer
  System call 'NEWOBJECT' (to create object by user handlers)

-----------------------------------------------Questionable features:
  Parent OD (daughter OD has only OVs that uses database of parent OD, so it is useful to divide OV betewen two or more OD)
  Autonavigate command for OV, for a example single mouse click on a cell edit the element. Mouse single click command: NONE|DBLCLICK|KEYPRESS. Usefull for chats
  Fool protection by not allowing to block all users from changing DB props, so none can add/delete/change views, elements and rules.
  Pagination. Should i use it or app concept is to out whole selection and manage object number by its object selection?
    should i use page output when next portion of objects are displayed by reaching screen bottom at scrolling? So implemet object-per-page (and other features around) in user customization misc configuration
  Predefined system messages and help section can be displayed on other languages
  Open OV in new tab in a read-only mode just by coping inner html of main div
  Max object version stored in DB, possible options: no property at all, cut older version to fit the max versions, do not allow new versions at max versions exceeded
    (Max object versions in range 0-65535. Emtpy or undefined string - zero value)
  helpdesk/jira/CRM example in Help context menu
  Create system user read-only customization like github interface, for a example, so users can use it via 'force' option in user-customization dialog
  No Emodzi symbols as an element text allowed - in this case db sql error occurs. Should i fix it?
  Task manager load avergage more than one or specified threshold? Mark it red color at taask manager title

-----------------------------------------------Slava representation:
Y-combinator
big amount of data with faaster and quick perfomance
data is native
data constructor
voting
keep last twoversions
don't add objects more than 100
readonly from mark to john, but not from john to mark
to leave only last two versions create rule: delete from data_1 where id=:oid and version <= :postversion -2, odtable -> odid!
